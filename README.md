# Mastering Functional Programming With Typescript Exercises

These exercises come from the fantastic book [Mastering Functional Programming with TypeScript](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Functional-Programming-TypeScript-Applications-ebook/dp/B0CW1DNLRX) by Art Deineka. Specifically, this book focuses on learning FP through the [`fp-ts`](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) library.

The goal of this repo is to document my journey in diving deeper into functional programming using TypeScript. While I have been writing ["functional-light"](https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS) JavaScript for years, I have only recently begun exploring the deeper concepts of full functional languages, including algebraic data types leveraged offered by libraries like `fp-ts`.
